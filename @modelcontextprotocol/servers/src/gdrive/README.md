# Google Drive server

This MCP server integrates with Google Drive to allow listing, reading, and searching over files.

## Components

### Tools

- **search**
  - Search for files in Google Drive
  - Input: `query` (string): Search query
  - Returns file names and MIME types of matching files

### Resources

The server provides access to Google Drive files:

- **Files** (`gdrive:///<file_id>`)
  - Supports all file types
  - Google Workspace files are automatically exported:
    - Docs → Markdown
    - Sheets → CSV
    - Presentations → Plain text
    - Drawings → PNG
  - Other files are provided in their native format

## Getting started

1. [Create a new Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)
2. [Enable the Google Drive API](https://console.cloud.google.com/workspace-api/products)
3. [Configure an OAuth consent screen](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) ("internal" is fine for testing)
4. Add OAuth scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly`
5. [Create an OAuth Client ID](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/oauthclient) for application type "Desktop App"
6. Download the JSON file of your client's OAuth keys
7. Rename the key file to `gcp-oauth.keys.json` and place into the root of this repo (i.e. `servers/gcp-oauth.keys.json`)

Make sure to build the server with either `npm run build` or `npm run watch`.

### Authentication

To authenticate and save credentials:

1. Run the server with the `auth` argument: `node ./dist auth`
2. This will open an authentication flow in your system browser
3. Complete the authentication process
4. Credentials will be saved in the root of this repo (i.e. `servers/.gdrive-server-credentials.json`)

### Usage with Desktop App

To integrate this server with the desktop app, add the following to your app's server configuration:

#### Docker

Authentication:

Assuming you have completed setting up the OAuth application on Google Cloud, you can now auth the server with the following command, replacing `/path/to/gcp-oauth.keys.json` with the path to your OAuth keys file:

```bash
docker run -i --rm --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/gcp-oauth.keys.json,target=/gcp-oauth.keys.json -v mcp-gdrive:/gdrive-server -e GDRIVE_OAUTH_PATH=/gcp-oauth.keys.json -e "GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/gdrive-server/credentials.json" -p 3000:3000 mcp/gdrive auth
```

The command will print the URL to open in your browser. Open this URL in your browser and complete the authentication process. The credentials will be saved in the `mcp-gdrive` volume.

Once authenticated, you can use the server in your app's server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gdrive": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-v", "mcp-gdrive:/gdrive-server", "-e", "GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/gdrive-server/credentials.json", "mcp/gdrive"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### NPX

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "gdrive": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-gdrive"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

For manual installation, add the following JSON block to your User Settings (JSON) file in VS Code. You can do this by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` and typing `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.

Optionally, you can add it to a file called `.vscode/mcp.json` in your workspace. This will allow you to share the configuration with others.

> Note that the `mcp` key is not needed in the `.vscode/mcp.json` file.
